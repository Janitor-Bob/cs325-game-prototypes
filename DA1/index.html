<h2>The Lost Astronaut</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The most original element of the game is how the level generates as progress is made. Instead of the screen moving or things being taken away, the level continues to form as the player makes progress.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
There is relatively little techincal merit, the most complex action taking place is the tiles generating as a collision between the player and switch is detected.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot about simple phaser mechanics, such as how to control collisions and overlaps and use them to cause events in the game, as well as how to add custom images/sounds into a phaser game. <br>
The hardest part was getting things to not fly off the map as they were touched. I tried making them static but found it easier to just box the switches in with invisible walls as I wanted them to change later and didn't know how to do that with static objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>All sprites were taken from this source originating from http://kenney.nl: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-pixel-redux">Spritesheet</a></li>
<li>Lever Sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/DrMinky/sounds/167048/">FreeSound.org</a></li>
<li>Victory Sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/jimhancock/sounds/376318/">FreeSound.org</a></li>
<li>Background Music: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/Mrthenoronha/sounds/476547/">FreeSound.org</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is heavily based on the first phaser game tutorial found <a href="http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1"> here.</a> The code for gravity, collisions, and event overlap triggers was all borrowed from that tutorial. I also used the keyboard input and player movement code from that tutorial.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Explore an unknown world as a lost astronaut.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the only add things to the screen challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Direct, Keyboard <br>
Randomness: Deterministic <br>
Play Styles: This is mostly an Explorer play style, however the game is so simplistic it does not get extensively used. <br>
Genres: Platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The most clear example is the kinesthetic feel of the game, which turned out to be fairly clunky but this prototype gives an opportunity to work upon and improve that aspect.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to have a sense of mystery and exploration, trying to navigate the level and figure out what to do next.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player moves around with the arrow keys. The up arrow key allows the player to jump, while the left and right arrow keys moves them left and right, respectively. Hitting the various levers around the level generates extra parts of the level that are required for them to progress. The player wins by reaching the flag at the top of the level.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Following the intended route, and not falling when jumping between blocks.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is fairly abstract, the main player is an astronaut that has been seperated from his ship and finds himself in a new and unknown world. He has to explore and interact with the world to make his way through it. As he progresses, he learns more, and is able to discover new and exciting things.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is targetted at fans of platforming games that aren't looking for something super challenging, but want to explore and discover a new world through a low-risk platforming game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1-2 Minutes
</li>
